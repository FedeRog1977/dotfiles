Excellent first night in Berlers; a few curryvoorshts then gay smoking chamber for beers and reds. Up nice and fresh on Friday at midday for a treat out of the breakfast rouge dispenser and off to fishmarket south after some excellent coffware. Did some general strolling around some shops and Lime’ing, went in some questionable shops and ended up at a fine sushware dinner place. Then off to Bergers for two attempts. I’m sure you can figure how they went. Off to another smoking chamber then a cocktail chamber to roll-in the night. Once again, up at midday on the Saturday and off to Wilmers café for a bagers and coffee. Then a stroll down to the parlers but I got kb’d so I went a stroll around shops. Place called Lokal for dinner after like three down in some royal chamber bar, probably too wasted to enjoy it as much as it deserved. Onwards to some keeosks for some street beers. Then Pirers. Met a nice coke dealer and Crug got pretty wasted. I’ll keep those videos and pictures to ourselves. Even after dinner, chips and a burger at a Rate My Takeaway chamber, and three kebabs; CG was too wasted to get out of bed on the Sunday so Awaz and I went a stroll around the rich district, went to a choccy chamber, and Five Guys for lunch (aha). Finally met CG to go to the one Xmas market that was actually open and downed some mullers and eggers. Then to a beereria finally for a final cooryvoorsht. Early night for the Monday morning flight.",

Uncle.Sank a good crate of frizzante too. We had a money-optimizing start to Saturday with CG remaining in slumber until 9:59 then it was off to ‘leven for my first fat dab of the Mamores. Shame, I was kinda hoping my first hit of these would be running all ten in one but, I suppose its ‘too late in the year’ for that. Anyway, it was good to be running a sea-to-summit (sort of) again after so much time in the Cairny G’s recently. The route was routine, good runn’r. The many-different-kind-terrain was also a good brek’r in for the fresh rubber. Pack-a-Punched up a Coop meal deal dinner and got ready for the weekend to take a big turn. Another 50 miles to Edinburgh and back to witness a Hard.Style performance with some management passes, a MEGAPINT and thicc milks. Came back down to earth on Sunday though, with the Troon solo followed my Christoph Tile.",

Then off to Aviemore for a Mambos sesh and a bottle of rum down in the currum. Four hours of sleep, clean shave then out to Route 7 for brekkers then Le Tour De Outdoor Shops.

Saturday was supposed to be Schoolhouse redemption. Weather was perfect and very encouraging however, the mix of 0 tread and greasy rock didn’t let me get the satisfaction I wanted. Unfortunately it was a return to ground level once again. Ideally should have done plan B which was Bidean again for the inversion. Instead I just observed the inversion under Bidean from Schoolers.

Over a week that the ALL had been in the geerage meaning I couldn’t run the originally intended Cairn Toul proj because of the drive-in and need for an early start. So I booked my first non-west-highland-line highland train ticket and bukked two nights in Hamish’s dungeon. The sofa sex chamber. The Aviemore Youth Hostel. My first time soloing a hostel, and doing it right too, with one of those nights in a shared room. Anyway, quiet Friday with one beer and some dev. Also some dood had a shared rant with me about ThinkPads, was excellent. ‘Twas the bus the next morning to the Ski Centre car park to take off on by backup plan, Cairn Gorm and Macdui. Excellent conditions straight into the very unexpected, but glorious, snow storm. Bit disappointing though, 60mph snow gusts stopped me from getting over to Macdui again. So I had a quick coffee and ran the walk-out, in a very Just Cause 2 climate-change-like fashion. Another quiet night cooking up a storm, running Mambos for two, then soloing a crate and Star Wars in the currum. Didn’t get to do much on the Sunday, train times weren’t very forgiving. Tried Route 7. Denied. So just browsed a few outdoor shops and went home. Much. Needed.",

It was a summon into L’Amirale on Friday night, upon which PMB honoured us with his presence. It was probably the best effort of J. Vitra and myself in a while. The intra-meery chicken and horitho haircut helped. Then back to see off the last of out eight-down. Good game of ‘nis on Saturday, J.’s first since the injury. But bodies do what you tell them to. As the great finale, J. and I were once again honoured with the company of PMB for a comprehensive spread at Turbers, along with many formalities and traditions. Finally bagged Tommy’s for an oat flatters before helping PMB with some hauling on Sunday.",

No one will ever be worthy of a retirement party quite like the one we’ve just witnessed. After this, when the mourning period began, week took to three chads, three medium body. Then three crates. Bed at 6:30am. It was a swift 10am rise on Saturday to r’watch Roger’s ceremony a good few times. We finally dragged ourselves out into the sunshine at 5pm for a quickie to St. Abbs. Back for some sausage rigger tony and more beer, small. Sunday was good coz I sat in the car park for the SubTwo’er Meikle Says Law and r’watched Roger’s ceremony again. GG.",

The nought-point-nought-nought-five-five-hour drive-in was a success, with an 8:15 ressie at DorsiaVerna, until I found out the Pirellis couldn’t take the heat on the mildly-stony single-tracks. Two flats meant it was Ben Hope foloowed by six hours of Miami Vice waiting for a tow truck to Ullerrpooul the next day. Pitched in a very inappropriate place and ran a Doomer depression Tesco meal deal dinner. Hit a sub-two’er the following day, in-line with Sunday tradition. It was probably the highlight of the trip. Got COLD quickly and headed to the Argyle Hotel for wasted, followed by a seafood dinner, followed by wasted. Monday was Doomer. We moved our tents to the campsite and ran the tour of the outdoor centre and localé cafés. Then the leisure centre, finally for a shower. Hit up a pizza truck afterwards. Tuesday was even more Doomer with my tyres being delayed til Wednesday, so it was another day at the leisure centre sauna and a Doomer pea and mint Tesco soup for dinner. And ahh jeez, a mouse ate my tent so we had to move pitch. It was an early Doomer bed one, although I didn’t really get back to sleep after the craic kicked off with the First Lady’s arm amputation because of the thunderstorm. Wednesday promised a new hope, the ALL was collected first-thing and it was off to Ben More Assynt. Successful proj. Groin injury for me however. So took the counterpart to Ben Kilbreck while I cought up on Better Call Saul in the ALL. Then the most Doomer issue of all kicked off. The midge attack had me running lengths of the road in the ALL with all the windows open. Only thing was, one didn’t come back up. So yeah, 11:30pm set-off on the road home. Don’t remember much of it tbh, fell asleep six times. So Griff had to take over at Bruar. There was a strong five hours of Doomer Jazz played on that drive-out. The best meme was realising my chain was on when I got home so it was another night in the ALL for me.",

A few hay fever seizures later, we were in the Coach & Four you and me and you, running a fine two-courser. Also on easyJet. In fact, just let it be known that from this point until Munich, everything was on seazyJet. Finally bagged the cycle cafeé, then the god-awful pub next to the optician’s for a game of pool. We retired to slumber over some yellow labels and La Guy D’Familia and Papa D’Americano. In traditionalé Wilmers fashion, the next day begun with some Giada then a Juniper all-you-can-eat. The day’s activities formed a very soy trip into Manchester to browse Soylfridges and experience the glorious three different kind seafood with rice stick (rice pasta). I did pick up a good Crockett piece from Uni Qlo which made some appearances in Italy. Let’s not forget the £15 of mocha ice cream afterwards. Once again, the night was capped with some La Guy D’Familia and Papa D’Americano. The third day under the dome started with much hope but a drone of Doomer depression.

We decided to tun the free-for-all dinner beta and end up in the place that looked best. This paid off big-time. Don’t even remember the name but, first place we ended up served possibly the finest meal I’ve ever blessed my (goddamn) palate with. Some magnificent tagliatelle followed by wild boar ragù, served alongside a house red and some homebrews. The best of the night was still to come however. Romeo five-star beereria, Verona. The greatest drinking establishment on earth. Negronis with branded ice cubes, herheyhas, and Japanese ginseng freakin’ zen garden something cocktails. A stunning arena. Big shout-out to Edoardo Bullio dood. The next morning capped her off well, with a glorious pistachio pasteria. We weren’ leaving ‘til just after midday though so there was of course time for a bellini, negroni and herheyha pre-train.

The herheyhas helped, and the pizza lunch. There wasn’t much more to day one, just dinner at a very average restaurant (still better than any UK restaurant). The squid ink, wait for it..., squid was pretty okay actually. Obviously off to some bar afterwards, one which I don’t remember because they all blend into one. It was a 4am finish though, I can tell you that. A midday rise the next day saw us in desperate need of some frizzante and a coffeeria. We had a stroll and not long later came across a fine Farineria (Farini). Only the greatest pizzeria, drafteria, mojiteria and goddamn everything elseria in Venice (and Milano). We went a few [slices and pintés] down in there before the Trip Advisor special and another night of beereria, followed by that famous gelateria. Whatever it’s called. Ahh this was also the night of Brando, and friends. And James’ wannabe figure, the Celiaeria, who definitely shops at Celinerias. ‘nuff said. The final day kicked off with more frizzante and another trip to Farini, via the (non-existent) Casino Royaleria bank, for more sliceria. We bagged an excellent restaurant on the final day, definitely the finest we’d been to in Venice. It was basically a wine shop but their, whatever the name is for, Italian tapas was amazing. Anyway 5:30am rise the next day for departure from Four Different Kind Hol-e-day.",

We hit up House of Allroads afterwards for a quickie ice crémà and some lorne for the next day. AwazFM and I ran some pretty damn good steak and mac-cheese for diesel, over a bottle of Wilmslow’s finest Casa Italinio Chianti. Capped the night with an even more successful one at the Dalwhinnie lodge where we double-downed on pint and cocktail each round. I’m pretty sure that, even though we didn’t realize it, we were kicked out. Back at Lee’s, Jooma and I ran a night cap of Ferris Bueller’s Day Off over six teas. Ran a couple’ lorne for brekkie the next day then hit up Beinn One Hundred across from Beinn Day Before while AwazFM uprighted it in the FIVE.",

Then it was onto Morrisons Fort Bill for more cans and a double-down on Pringles and Manomasas. We pitched in the car park for the round and fired up the BBQ for the second double-down on the M&S 3 for £10 meat deal. It was McNeilerAwazFM and myself in the back of the FIVE this time, put to sleep by some Wojak. Saturday’s project was good. Back on the trend of long walk-ins but it was good to hit a couple’ ‘ros and Corbett tops. Shoutout to Sheena in Mallaig, accomodation is luxurious. Sunday was a slow day after a night in the Steam Inn (yes, the steamin’ mish) so no Beinn Guylian Chocolatier, but a stop in an Arisaig café and the Nevis Centre Fort Bill for lunch.",

After a leisurely start to Saturday, we made our way back to the one I promised myself I would never touch again, Ben Ùrar. However, it turned out to be an excellent decision. This hill certainly redeemed itself this weekend with the sun, snow, burn and Merrill Lynch corb. The Chinese chicken roast dinner service went excellently, ending with a standing ovation as Mark and I made our way from the kitchen, through the dining room, to the Range Rover. After that, it was off to the Clachaig for a heavy one followed by a crate and a Lewis dram before bed. Sunday saw a slower start and a very challenging lap of Glencoe Lochan. Accompanied by a debriefing over some Oomer content. Five erosions and on the road again. We made a pit stop in Tyndrum to finally bag a cheese wageburger at TJ’s.",

I removed 4l of Aviemore’s finest water from existence before bed so obviously I was fine for a 9am wake-up and promptly obliterated some lorne, ran a run and helped the mighty Hamish clean up the embarassment in the care home. When the rest finally dragged themselves up at 2pm, it was off to Loch Morlich for a 20 meter walk then back to the currum for Jile, Skyfall and tea. And, just a little rum and trop.

The drinking started early in the FIVE on the drive-in but I wasn’t complaining, we had plenty-a-crate to work out way through. Stuck to the traditional loaf on the drive-in too, before the M&S roast beef in the Aviemore Youth Hostel. We worked our way through about half a crate each then headed boys én tourè to Mambo’s, where Griff and I spent the evening sparking some questionable debates in the SUMC chat. They headed to whatever that Aviemore nightclub is called but of course I did a Lewis and just went back to the hostel and solo’d a few’ in an arm chair. This was the least messy of the nights. We were all still a little tender the next day however, and so saw the birth of the Aviemore care home. Lorne and trop down and off Murk and I went for an attempted walk around Loch Morlich. We only made it through the front door of the Pine Marten though. Couple coffees and the worst chips of our lives later, we attempted the walk-out. Oxy and the Griff had to rescue us in the FIVE on their abseiling drive-out however. Good Thai curry sobered us up right good after that. Gained me the title of the ‘Highland chef’ from Oxy. Anyway, after that it was straight back on the crates and ‘Lewis measure’ drams. That’s like a 300ml glass. Got us a good three bottles down between four people in no time. They headed back out to the nightclub after that. Who knows what I did. Give them the room key certainly wansn’t something I did. Woke up to smashed-up tube, cans, toilet paper and a wet flare sign the next morning so must have been a good one. Wee Route 7 Cafe sorted us out the next morning. Drive-out was very questionable.

It was part flex, part chad, and part “I’ve just had my Coooviiid Noynteen vaccine and want to prove it doesn’t effect me”. I was also recovering from a flu that I got, from the dumb 3am starts at my wagey job cucking and grinding for the paper (later leading to the A6 C6 TDV allroad TDI quattro, however), and grinding daily Strathaven cycles. Anyway, no need to complain, I deserve no sympathy. This was a damn good day. The Arrochar Alps still get a bad rep’ amongst more serious enthusiasts or ‘baggers’ (actually soys). However, how could you possibly deny the beauty and versatility of the playground that is these stunning four Munros, two Corbetts, and Corbett top? Especially when they’re basically in the back yard of the major western cities. The payoff for such a cheap day out is unmatched. Of course en route to having only seven minutes to spare at the train station, this route also saw the famous coining of the A82 Run-Out and its components: Slingshot, Freerun Frenzy, Tightrope Walk 1, and Tightrope Walk 2.",

It was another monumental day, seeing my longest project to date and the birth of the A82 run-out from the Ben Vorlich road. Sadly I didn’t hit Vorlich though because of, you guessed it, train times. However, the 3 mile run across the A82 and adjacent beach certainly made for the equivalent of another munro. For other Wojak reasons, this day was slightly monumental in another way. I mean, not in any way which lives up to the project itself but certainly in satisfaction of my ‘controysoytion to soyciety’ and my ‘footure’. I got the call half way Beinn Ìme from ScoyttishSoyer to tell me I’d been accepted on the scholarship. That is, I wouldn’t be paying the eight large for my upcoming Strathbloat course.

We all know about my two failed attempts on Ben Lui, laughable. “Dude you’re a bloody embarrassment”. But a few weeks later something clicked. Two of my friends were talking about going out to send the Lui Four and I’m not sure if it was jealousy of ability and being considered one of those incapable or, just simply that I was so anxious to prove to myself that I could do it but, it was in that moment that I drunkenly decided to book my second ticket to Tyndrum for one more attempt. Just in the passing of these few weeks though, my attitude changed. I’d felt a different kind of connection to hills and why people want to escape to them. I began to appreciate the freedom and happiness it can bring, instead of ticks on a 2007 website. So, I studied up on the literature, videos, and started to autistically learn all the hill and route beta because this time it actually excited me, it wasn’t just a task. I made my appearance in Tyndrum the following week and sent the Lui four. From then on, it was a summer of solo project, followed by solo project, followed by weekend duo project.

This was an excellent weekend with the gentlemen, starting with loading the Saab full of creates and barbeque food for the Thursday camp in the yard of the.. yuck.. Kingshouse Hotel. A freezing cold pitch with the tepid embrace of a Lost Layger drew us promptly to the bar at the Kingshouse, only to be let down by their lack of hospitality. Putting them in the middle finger club. Anyway, great day on Bidean next, even though I babied out of the summit. Followed by the classic Co-op dinner on the Glencoe Independent rage stove. Of course, also a lorne fry-up the next morning to fuly open her up. Saturday was excellent too. A successful Buachaille Etive Bagged. Clachaig for the second night, bit of Choi Dai for fingers ofc.",

			"description": "Ben Lui has done more for me than I can describe. My first attempt on Lui in April was only my third hike of the year which was still long before I had any real clue what I was doing. I mean, I couldn’t even tell the hill hottee we met on the walk-out the name of the hill. How embarassing! Anyway, I failed the first attempt because I started pooping my pants on a snow cornice about 100m from the top and it took me about 20 minutes to compose myself and slide back down. I returned the following Thursday on my first solo West Highland line venture, ice axe in hand, with full intention of making it to the top this time. It was the birth of my ‘go to the highlands and send and all day hike without telling anyone’ era. I’d planned a very different route which involved a traverse all the way from the NNE arête to the SW path from Beinn a’ Chleibh. I made it to about 900m again when the snow storm which had been lingering over Lochaber all day finally made its way down to Tyndrum. It was my first white-out. I was lucky if I could see five meters ahead in the best of it. It of course would have been beautiful if it wasn’t for the off-off-path vertical route I was taking. So at waist-deep snow, I made the executive decision to turn back once again. In days days following this, I began to think I was done with hiking. I’d always done it as a pass-time to this point, with friends, never really appreciating what it could mean for me.",

			"description": "What I didn’t realise when looking across from Ben More to Stob Binnein was just how much of a famous shot it was. I mean, it’s no ‘Executive Producer: Michael Mann’ freeze frame but it’s up there in the appreciation community of Scotland’s mountains. The cornice Stob Binnein is a winter landscape photographer’s dream. This project was still in the warm-up period of 2021 during the 4am phase and wow, what a great way it was to kick off the munro season for the year. It involved one of my favourite ascents to date: the north-westerly Ben More staircase. No walk-in, no slog, just up, up, up! It was about three quarters of the way up Ben More when we realised just how good the conditions were. We ran into patches of February/March snow and the low-level cloud began to roll back in. After topping out on the hill, I realised I was overlooking my first inversion. We’d timed it perfectly as well, the cloud was floating over the ridge between the twin peaks. Although I think the 4am start was getting to the Griff a bit because he spent ten minutes arguing that what were were looking at weren’t clouds, they were in fact “inversions, Britton”. Ahh, maybe Skye is part of the mainland after all. We perched on the top of Stob Binnein at 11:30am and enjoyed the albedo effect giving us a 15° sunbathe. When people ask why I wake up early for hills or sleep in the back of a car on Friday nights, I show them this.",
