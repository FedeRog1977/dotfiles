What is the point of this website? Well knowing me, I could be offed, booked, locked-up, fall off a Munro top, or fire too many bullets, at any moment. So, my thought was, why not put everything that’s ever gone through my mind right here? Head on with it at your own risk, and either follow the links to the right for my main projects (and Projects), or keep reading to dive into the deeper and darker realms.',

There are eight focuses of this website really, meaning there are eight things that sum up my effed-up personality: sport, exploration and travel, computers, academic crap, cooking, design, automotive interests, and other media. I have some trademarks, too many to get into here but you will be seeing a lot of hill Projects, including my greatest achievement of The Playground, and many more around my greatest love: the Scottish Highlands; Roadie Miles, including my century and various Strathavens and Fenwick + Wind Farms; Miles Miles, which these days tends to only extend to my never-ending Waterfoot streak; and, my (unfortunately) decaying obsession with Roger Federer’s tennis game. You can also browse all of my travel and explorations, shall we call them, on my rebellion against Instagram: Instant Gram. And feel free to steal any of the recipes you find in BrittonsFoodRC too. You may at some point find yourself caught in some obscure exploration of interiors, design, typography, stationery, classic goods collection, and media collection, etc. There’s also plenty of v-gin dev stuff in Linux, LaTeX, and web development. Also, not to forget the ThinkPads. If you are to venture into the unknown, check out Conquest (Burning Roots) and get a proj on the go in my experimental Ordnance-Survey-based mapping app. So yeah, good luck, have fun.',
