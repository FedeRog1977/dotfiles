What is the point of this website? Well knowing me, I could be offed, booked, locked-up, fall off a Munro top, or fire too many bullets, at any moment. So, my thought was, why not put everything that’s ever gone through my mind right here? Head on with it at your own risk, and either follow the links to the right for my main projects (and Projects), or keep reading to dive into the deeper and darker realms.',
