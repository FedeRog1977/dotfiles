I achieved distinction in third year when my course was spread across just Finance and Economics. Honours year Finance study focused on asset pricing, quantitative methods, corporate investment, and corporate financing. In fifth year, my MSc, topics focussed on database development, object oriented programming, software engineering, and cyber security and ethics.',

Both classes involved regular lab sessions in which databases were to be built and queried; an assignment for the former which involved taking information and formulating a logical database design with appropriate relationships and tables which was then constructed and queried accordingly; and an assignment for the latter which explored theory behind the history and use of relational databases, the rise of non-relational systems, and the concept and design of hybrid ones.',

The second was bases more so on standards and principals of project panning, design, workflow and management. These two classes were, once again, based on the delivery of assignments. The assignment for CS991 essentially involved the design and prototyping process of an application. This included elements such as working demonstrations and documentation, etc. There were two assignments for CS993 however, they both followed the same general framework: requirements gathering and ranking; user stories; project management, including software and team management; front-end (user interface) design and functionality; back-end design and functionality; test-driven development; and testing elements.',
